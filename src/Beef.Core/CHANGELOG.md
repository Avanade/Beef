## v2.1.17
- *Added:* New `Beef.Event.Subscribe` namespace added to enable the base capabilities for the subscription of events.

## v2.1.16
- *Added:* The `ReferenceDataSidList` has had a new method `ToCodeList` to get the list of codes added.
- *Added:* A new extenstion method `IQueryable.WhereWith` added to simply the specification of a where clause when the `with` value is not the `default`.

- *Fixed:* `TypeReflector.GetProperty` fixed to ensure only single named get/set property returned.
- *Added:* `ChangeLogMapper` added to ensure consistency mapping `ChangeLog` entity; specifically, the `Created*` and `Updated*` properties for the corresponding mapping operation type.
- *Fixed:* `EntityMapper` had a number of fixes made.

## v2.1.15
- *Fixed:* An `ExecutionContext.Username` get will return `Environment.UserName` as a default where not overridden to ensure a valid value is returned.

## v2.1.13
- *New:* Promoted `YamlConverter` into `Beef.Core` from `Beef.Test.NUnit` as it has an application beyond just testing.
- *Fixed:* `Factory.ResetLocal` to clear only for the running thread; not all. This resulted in wonky tests where mocking was not reliably functioning.
