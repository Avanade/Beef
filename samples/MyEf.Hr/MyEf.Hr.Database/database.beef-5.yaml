# Configuring the code-generation global settings
# - Schema defines the default for all tables unless explicitly defined.
# - Outbox indicates whether events will publish using the outbox pattern and therefore the event outbox artefacts are required.
# - EfModel indicates that an Entity Framework model should be generated for all tables unless specified otherwise.
