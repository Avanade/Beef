# Step 5 - Employee Search

This will walk through the process of creating and testing the employee search capability.

<br/>

## Functional requirement

The employee search will allow the following criteria to be searched:
- First and last name using wildcard (starts with, ends with and contains); e.g. `abc*`, `*abc` or `*abc*`.
- Gender selection; zero, one or more.
- Start date range (from/to).
- Option to include terminated employees (default is to exclude).

The search should also support paging. The results should be returned in last name, first name and start date order.

Examples of the endpoint are as follows (or any combination thereof).

Endpoint | Description
-|-
`GET /employees?lastName=smi*` | all employees whose last name starts with `smi`.
`GET /employees?gender=f` | all female employees.
`GET /employees?startFrom=2000-01-01&startTo=2002-12-31` | all employess who started between 01-Jan-2000 and 31-Dec-2002 (inclusive).
`GET /employess?lastName=smi*&includeTerminated=true` | all employees whose last name starts with `smi`, both current and terminated.
`GET /employees?gender=f&$skip=10&$take25` | all female employees with paging (skipping the first 10 employees and getting the next 25 in sequence).

<br/>

## Data repository

During the initial database set up process the `Employee` table was enabled via code-generation leveraging an Entity Framework model class. This will be used to perform the query operations so that we can leverage .NET's LINQ-style query filtering and sorting.

<br/>

## Selection criteria

The API selection criteria will be enabled by defining a class with all of the requisite properties. _Beef_ will then expose each of the properties individually within the API Controller to enable their usage. _Beef_ can also automatically enable paging support when selected to do so; therefore, this does not need to be enabled via the selection criteria directly.

Add the following entity code-gen configuration after all the other existing entities within `entity.beef-5.yaml` (`MyEf.Hr.CodeGen` project).

``` yaml
  # Creating an EmployeeArgs entity
  # - Genders will support a list (none or more) reference data values.
  # - StartFrom, StartTo and IncludeTerminated are all Nullable so we can tell whether a value was provided or not.
  # - The IsIncludeTerminated overrides the JsonName to meet the stated requirement name of includeTerminated.
- { name: EmployeeArgs, text: '{{Employee}} search arguments',
    properties: [
      { name: FirstName },
      { name: LastName },
      { name: Genders, type: ^Gender, refDataList: true },
      { name: StartFrom, type: 'DateTime?', dateTimeTransform: DateOnly },
      { name: StartTo, type: 'DateTime?', dateTimeTransform: DateOnly },
      { name: IsIncludeTerminated, jsonName: includeTerminated, type: 'bool?' }
    ]
  }
```

The requisite `GetByArgs` operation needs to be added to the `Employee` entity configuration.

Add the following to the array of operations after the existing `Delete` operation.

``` yaml
      # Search operation
      # - Type is GetColl that indicates that a collection is the expected result for the query-based operation.
      # - ReturnType is overriding the default Employee as we want to use EmployeeBase (reduced set of fields).
      # - Paging indicates that paging support is required and to be automatically enabled for the operation.
      # - Parameter specifies that a single parameter with a type of EmployeeArgs (defined later) is required and that the value should be validated.
      { name: GetByArgs, type: GetColl, paging: true, returnType: EmployeeBase,
        parameters: [
          { name: Args, type: EmployeeArgs, validator: EmployeeArgsValidator }
        ]
      }
```

Execute the code-generation using the command line (within `MyEf.Hr.CodeGen` base directory).

```
dotnet run entity
```

</br>

## Data access logic

Within the entity code-gen configuration where auto-implementation is not possible then the data access logic must be specified explicitly. _Beef_ will still generate the boilerplate/skeleton wrapping logic for the data access to ensure consistency, and will invoke a corresponding `*OnImplementation` method to perform (which the developer is then required to implement).

This logic must be implemented by the developer in a non-generated `partial` class. A new `EmployeeData.cs` must be created within `MyEf.Hr.Business/Data`; do **not** change any files under the `Generated` folder as these will be overridden during the next code-gen execution.

This new `EmployeeData.cs` (non-generated) logic will need to be extended to support the new `GetByArgs`. 

For query operations generally we do not implement using the custom `*OnImplementation` approach; as the primary code, with the exception of the actual search criteria can be generated successfully. As such, in this case _Beef_ will have generated an extension delegate named `_getByArgsOnQuery` to enable. This extension delegate will be passed in the `IQueryable<EfModel.Employee>` so that filtering and sorting, etc. can be applied, as well as the search arguments (`EmployeeArgs`). _Note:_ no paging is passed, or needs to be applied, as _Beef_ will apply this automatically.

Extensions within _Beef_ are leveraged by implementing the partial constructor method (`EmployeeDataCtor`) and providing an implementation for the requisite extension delegate (`_getByArgsOnQuery`). The `With` methods are enabled by _CoreEx_ to simplify the code logic to apply the filter only where the value is not `null`, plus specifically handle the likes of wildcards. Also note usage of [`IgnoreAutoIncludes`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.entityframeworkcore.entityframeworkqueryableextensions.ignoreautoincludes) (a standard Entity Framework capability) to avoid the cost of loading related data that is not needed for this query. 

Within the `MyEf.Hr.Business/Data` folder, create `EmployeeData.cs` and implement as follows:

``` csharp
partial void EmployeeDataCtor()
{
    // Implement the GetByArgs OnQuery search/filtering logic.
    _getByArgsOnQuery = (q, args) =>
    {
        _ef.WithWildcard(args?.FirstName, w => q = q.Where(x => EF.Functions.Like(x.FirstName!, w)));
        _ef.WithWildcard(args?.LastName, w => q = q.Where(x => EF.Functions.Like(x.LastName!, w)));
        _ef.With(args?.Genders, g => q = q.Where(x => g.ToCodeList().Contains(x.GenderCode)));
        _ef.With(args?.StartFrom, f => q = q.Where(x => x.StartDate >= f));
        _ef.With(args?.StartTo, t => q = q.Where(x => x.StartDate <= t));

        if (args?.IsIncludeTerminated is null || !args.IsIncludeTerminated.Value)
            q = q.Where(x => x.TerminationDate == null);

                return q.IgnoreAutoIncludes().OrderBy(x => x.LastName).ThenBy(x => x.FirstName).ThenBy(x => x.StartDate);
            };
        }
    }
}
```

<br/>

## Validation

Within the `MyEf.Hr.Business/Validation` folder, create `EmployeeArgsValidator.cs` and implement as follows:

``` csharp
namespace MyEf.Hr.Business.Validation;

/// <summary>
/// Represents a <see cref="EmployeeArgs"/> validator.
/// </summary>
public class EmployeeArgsValidator : Validator<EmployeeArgs>
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Initializes a new instance of the <see cref="EmployeeValidator"/> class.
    /// </summary>
    public EmployeeArgsValidator()
    {
        Property(x => x.FirstName).Common(CommonValidators.PersonName).Wildcard();
        Property(x => x.LastName).Common(CommonValidators.PersonName).Wildcard();
        Property(x => x.Genders).AreValid();
        Property(x => x.StartFrom).CompareProperty(CompareOperator.LessThanEqual, x => x.StartTo);
    }
}
```

<br/>

## End-to-End testing

Now that we've implemented `GetByArgs` search functionality, we can re-add the appropriate tests. Do so by un-commenting the region `GetByArgs` within `MyEf.Hr.Test/Apis/EmployeeTest.cs`.

As extra homework, you should also consider implementing unit testing for the validator.

<br/>

## Verify

At this stage we now have added and tested the employee search, in addition to the employee CRUD APIs.

To verify, build the solution and ensure no compilation errors.

Check the output of code gen tool. There should have been 2 new and 9 updated files similar to the below output:

```
MyEf.Hr.CodeGen Complete. [1818ms, Files: Unchanged = 16, Updated = 9, Created = 2, TotalLines = 1584]
```

Within test explorer, run the `EmployeeTest` set of tests and confirm they all pass.

The following tests were newly added and should pass:

```
A210_GetByArgs_All
A220_GetByArgs_All_Paging
A230_GetByArgs_FirstName
A240_GetByArgs_LastName
A250_GetByArgs_LastName_IncludeTerminated
A260_GetByArgs_Gender
A270_GetByArgs_Empty
A280_GetByArgs_FieldSelection
A290_GetByArgs_RefDataText
A300_GetByArgs_ArgsError
```

<br/>

## OData-like Query

The above search capability is great and for most use cases is perfectly acceptable; however, it is not as flexible as the likes of OData or GraphQL. 

Therefore, depending on the functional needs a more flexible query capability may be required. There is basic, explicit, OData-like support available where this need arises; this will now be added to the `MyEf.Hr` solution. See [`CoreEx.Data.Querying`](https://github.com/Avanade/CoreEx/tree/main/src/CoreEx.Data#odata-like-querying) for more information on the underlying implementation. 

_Note:_ Where OData and GraphQL are specifically required then they would need to be implemented separately as the Avanade accelerators do not provide this functionality out-of-the-box.

<br/>

### OData-like requirements

A single `query` endpoint will be added to enable, and support the same requirements using OData-like filtering:

Endpoint | Description
-|-
`GET /employees/query?$filter=startswith(lastName, 'smi*')` | all employees whose last name starts with `smi`.
`GET /employees/query?$filter=gender eq 'f'` | all female employees.
`GET /employees/query?$filter=startdate ge 2000-01-01 and startdate le 2002-12-31` | all employess who started between 01-Jan-2000 and 31-Dec-2002 (inclusive).
`GET /employees/query?$filter=startswith(lastName, 'smi*') and (terminated eq null \|\| terminated ne null)` | all employees whose last name starts with `smi`, both current and terminated.
`GET /employees?gender=f&$skip=10&$take25` | all female employees with paging (skipping the first 10 employees and getting the next 25 in sequence).

<br/>

### Code-generation

The following code-gen should be added after the `GetByArgs` configuration; this will add the `query` endpoint to the `Employee` entity.

``` yaml
      # Query operation
      # - Type is GetColl that indicates that a collection is the expected result for the query-based operation.
      # - ReturnType is overriding the default Employee as we want to use EmployeeBase (reduced set of fields).
      # - Query indicates that OData-like $filter/$order support is to be enabled.
      # - Paging indicates that paging support is required and to be automatically enabled for the operation.
      # - WebApiRoute specifies the route of 'query' to be used for the operation.
      { name: GetByQuery, type: GetColl, query: true, paging: true, returnType: EmployeeBase, webApiRoute: query }
```

Execute the code-generation again using the command line (within `MyEf.Hr.CodeGen` base directory) and the various artefacts will be updated (generated).

### Data access logic

The `EmployeeData.cs` partial class (non generated) will need to be extended to support the new `GetByQuery` operation.

Firstly, the `QueryArgsConfig` must be instantiated with the desired configuration. This will explicitly add support for the specified fields to achieve the desired functionality:

``` csharp
public partial class EmployeeData
{
    private static readonly QueryArgsConfig _config = QueryArgsConfig.Create()
        .WithFilter(filter => filter
            .AddField<string>(nameof(Employee.LastName), c => c.WithOperators(QueryFilterOperator.AllStringOperators).WithUpperCase())
            .AddField<string>(nameof(Employee.FirstName), c => c.WithOperators(QueryFilterOperator.AllStringOperators).WithUpperCase())
            .AddReferenceDataField<Gender>(nameof(Employee.Gender), nameof(EfModel.Employee.GenderCode))
            .AddField<DateTime>(nameof(Employee.StartDate))
            .AddNullField(nameof(Employee.Termination), nameof(EfModel.Employee.TerminationDate), c => c.WithDefault(new QueryStatement($"{nameof(EfModel.Employee.TerminationDate)} == null"))))
        .WithOrderBy(orderby => orderby
            .AddField(nameof(Employee.LastName))
            .AddField(nameof(Employee.FirstName))
            .WithDefault($"{nameof(Employee.LastName)}, {nameof(Employee.FirstName)}"));
```

Secondly, the `GetByQuery` operation must be implemented. Add the following to the end of the `EmployeeDataCtor` method to enable the functionality:

``` csharp
        // Implement the GetByQuery OnQuery search/filtering logic using OData-like query syntax.
        _getByQueryOnQuery = (q, args) => q.IgnoreAutoIncludes().Where(_config, args).OrderBy(_config, args);
```

<br/>

### End-to-End testing

Now that we've implemented `GetByQuery` search functionality, we can re-add the appropriate tests. Do so by un-commenting the region `GetByQuery` within `MyEf.Hr.Test/Apis/EmployeeTest.cs`. Within test explorer, run the `EmployeeTest` set of tests and confirm they all pass.

<br/>

## Next Step

Next we will implement the [employee termination](./6-Employee-Terminate.md) endpoint.
