  # Creating an Employee base with only the subset of fields that we want returned from the GetByArgs.
  # - As we will be returning more than one we need the Collection and CollectionResult.
  # - Any Text with a handlebars '{{xxx}}' is a shortcut for .NET see comments; e.g. '<see cref="xxx"/>'.
  # - ExcludeAll is used so only the entity (not other layers are generated); with the exception of ExcludeData of false where it is a special case to output a DataMapper.
  # - Use of DataName is to reference the name of the column where different to the property name iteself.
  # - Use of DataAutoGenerated indicates that the data source will automatically generate the value.
  # - A Type with RefDataNamespace.* is how to reference a reference data entity (will default RefDataType to 'string').
  # - A DateTimeTransform of DateOnly is used to indicate that the DateTime property should only be concerned with the Date component.
  # - ETag and ChangeLog are special case and Beef will automatically map between RowVersion and other Audit columns where they exist.
  # - AutoImplement of Database will ensure that the DbMapper is generated; used by the Employee.Get/Create/Update.
  # - By specifying the EntityFrameworkEntity the EfMapper (mapping to defined type will be mapped) will also be generated; used by the Employee.GetByArgs.
  # - The Termination property DataEntityFrameworkIgnore is set as this cannot be automatically generated; custom code will need to be developed to handle; used by the Employee.GetByArgs.

  # Creating an Employee inheriting from EmployeeBase (DataMapper will also inherit).

  # - The WebApiRoutePrefix is defined, which is in turn extended by each operation.
  # - The EntityFrameworkEntity is required so that the GetByArgs code-gen knows what EfModel is to be used; however, DataEntityFrameworkCustomMapper is also used so that a corresponding EfMapper is not output (not required).
