  # Creating an Employee base with only the subset of fields that we want returned from the GetByArgs.
  # - As we will be returning more than one we need the Collection and CollectionResult.
  # - Any Text with a handlebars '{{xxx}}' is a shortcut for .NET see comments; e.g. '<see cref="xxx"/>'.
  # - ExcludeAll is used so only the entity (not other layers are generated); with the exception of ExcludeData of RequiresMapper where it is a special case to output a DataMapper.
  # - Use of DataName is to reference the name of the column where different to the property name iteself.
  # - Use of DataAutoGenerated indicates that the data source will automatically generate the value.
  # - A Type with a '^' prefix is shorthand for 'RefDataNamespace.*', this is how to reference a reference data entity (will default RefDataType to 'string' where not specified).
  # - A DateTimeTransform of DateOnly is used to indicate that the DateTime property should only be concerned with the Date component.
  # - AutoImplement of Database will ensure that the DbMapper is generated; used by the Employee.Get/Create/Update.
  # - By specifying the EntityFrameworkModel the EfMapper (mapping to defined type) will also be generated; used by the Employee.GetByArgs.
