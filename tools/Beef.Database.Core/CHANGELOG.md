# Change log

Represents the **NuGet** versions.

## v3.1.2
- *Fixed:* Migrations scripts were being executed by `DbUp` in alphabetical order regardless of Assembly order (`DbUp` default); now will execute in Assembly, then alphabetical order (override).
- *Fixed:* Migrations scripts were being executed by `DbUp` as `WithTransactionPerScript` which has been updated to `WithoutTransaction` as some DDL statements cannot run within a transactional context. However, it is recommended where possible that each migration script is transactional to avoid partial update on script failure; i.e. each script should only perform a single unit of work to ensure database consistency at all times.

## v3.1.1
- *Upgrade:* Upgraded the project to .NET Standard 2.1 (compatible with .NET Core 3.1).
- *Enhancement:* Tool updated to execute asynchoronously. Both `DatabaseConsole` and `DatabaseConsoleWrapper` have breaking change; `Run` has been removed, replaced with `RunAsync`.

## v2.1.9
- *Fixed:* `fnGetUsername` updated to support usernames as `nvarchar(1024)` to enable any reasonable username size to be supported. This is the same as what is currently supported by `spSetSessionContext`.

## v2.1.8
- *Enhancement:* Sprinkled `Task.ConfigureAwait(false)` as per https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/configureawait-faq/.

## v2.1.7
- *Fixed:* Introduced FxCop Analysis to `Beef.Database.Core`; this version represents the remediation based on the results.

## v2.1.6
- *Fixed:* Database merge statements updated to include `AND EXISTS (...)` for a `WHEN MATCHED` to avoid updates where column data has not changed.

## v2.1.5
- *Enhancement:* All usernames will be set to `ExecutionContext.EnvironmentUsername` (this results in the same outcome).

## v2.1.4
- *Fixed:* Internal *Beef* dependencies changed as a result of other changes.

## v2.1.3
- *Fixed:* Create of new script will no longer make the schema and table names lowercase for the script file name and will honour the input case.

## v2.1.2
- *Fixed:* Inconsistent version numbers.

## v2.1.1
- *New:* Initial publish to GitHub.
